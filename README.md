# django-web_app
Full featured web application using Django and Python.

The main idea is to build the bases for a blog, so I can later fit it to the needs of a client.
So far, the blog has a main page where a User can create not only a profile and log in/out, but also to write a post. And both apps, be saved on a DB.

The idea is to build it mainly on Django, host it on Linode and be able to use an already gotten domain with an https protocol.
